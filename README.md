Name : John Lezama

I am a Senior in Tomball High School eager to deepen my skills in engineering and research to solve real world problems.

## Elecotromyography Controlled Prosthetic Arm
Date: October, 2023 - Febuary, 2024

Developed a motorized prosthetic arm for my 10th Grade Science Fair Project using DC motors, various mechanisms and H-Bridge motor drivers. I then intergrated EMG sensors and developed an alogorithm that converted those EMG signals into motor function.

Key Skills: Designing (AutoDesk Inventor), 3D-printing Assembly, Arduino Programming, Soldering, Electronics, Neuro-control

* Key Arduino Projects:
  ** First Project!
  Date: 2018

  My passion for motors and mechanisms began at a very young age. One of my very first projects was supplying power to a tiny DC motor to connect two magnets together.

  ** Pencil Printer (8th Grade Science Fair Project, 2022)

  I wanted to put my 3D printing and programming skills to the test for my first Science Fair project. I created a CNC machine that would draw any image uploaded to it via micro SD-card, I achieved this through the following steps:
  1. Programming a Python edge detection program to convert colored images into outlined gray scale images.
  2. Get the pixel locations for the edges and save those coordinates onto a micro SD card.
  3. Connect the micro SD card to the Arduino and calculate the steps each stepper motor needs to take to reach the coordinates.
  4. Plot the point with the pencil, controlled by a servo motor.


## FIRST Robotics - Mechanical Lead
Date: 2024-2025 Season

As the Mechanical Lead for my High School's FRC Robotics team I held several key responsibilities:
* I helped build a large part of the prototyping and assemmbly of the competition robot 
* Prepared and presented mechanical lessons for the new members.
* Led over 30 members in the construction of the field elements.
