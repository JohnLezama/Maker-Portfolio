1st Project! (2022)

My passion for motors and mechanisms began at a very young age. One of my very first projects was supplying power to a tiny DC motor to connect two magnets together.

Pencil Printer (8th Grade Science Fair Project, 2022)

![Demo](Assets/PencilPrinter1.gif)

Materials:
* 2 Stepper Motors
* Timing Belts
* 3D-Printed Parts
* Servo Motor
* Arduino Uno
* Micro SD Card & Adapter
* 2 9V Batteries
* Pencil

I wanted to put my 3D printing and programming skills to the test for my first Science Fair project. 
The methodology goes as follows:
1. Upload an image onto a python edge detection program and convert the image from color to black and white edges.
2. Get the pixel locations for the edges and save those coordinates onto a micro SD card
3. Connect the micro SD card to the Arduino and calculate the steps each stepper motor needs to take to reach the coordinate
4. Plot the point with the pencil, controlled by a servo motor.
